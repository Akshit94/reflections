What happens when you initialize a repository?

	A .git hidden directory is created that contains all the basics for a repository.
 
Why do you need to do it?
	In order to make a repository of project and use the power of version-control
	to make it more efficient.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
	Staging area is a step where you can review the changes or correct them if any
	error or bug appears before finally commiting it. In the working directory the files
	of the previous commit or the initial starting file are stored whereas in the 
	repository the final commited changes are stored.

What value do you think it offers?


	It offers us to check our project once more before finally comitting the changes
	thus leading to a more efficient project.
